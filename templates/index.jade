		h1 A flexible NodeJS Blogging CMS

		p.lead.
			blogrh is a simple, pluggable NodeJS blogging and gallery content management system.
			It's highly flexible as it plugs in a backend to handle a blog and gallery only. How you use
			the created entries is up to you.

			So you have an existing express application? Here is the blog system. Just install it using npm,
			plug it into your app and you're done. Query the blog entries in your routes to embed them into your views.
			It's up to you how you use them.

		h3 How do I use it?
		p.
			You need to have an express app set up. Once you've done that its a simple three step process to get
			up and running:

		ol
			li Install blogrh using npm
			li Call the register function to plug in blogrh into your express ap
			li Query Blog Entries or Gallery Objects and use them in your app

		p.
			Once you've registered blogrh the backend will be available calling <code>/admin</code>.
			User administation is available over the command line.
			Head over to github for the full documentation.
