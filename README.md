# rouvenherzog-demo

This is the demo application for [rouvenherzog](https://github.com/rouvenherzog/rouvenherzog).

rouvenherzog is a simple, pluggable NodeJS blogging and gallery content management system.
It's highly flexible as it plugs in a backend to handle a blog and gallery only.
How you use the created entries is up to you.
